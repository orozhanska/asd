# Task A: Merge K Sorted Arrays
# Score: 1.5 points
# ● Given K-sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array using the “merging”
# algorithm.
# ● It’s not allowed to add all elements to a single array and then sort it.
# ● Example: k = 3, [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [0, 7, 8]] -> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# ● Size of arrays can be different.
# ● Explain the time & space complexity of your algorithm
